# Industrial IoT Integration Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains the work and findings from my internship project at **Jindal Steel and Power (JSPL)** in Raigarh. The project's objective was to integrate advanced IoT and cloud technologies to enhance the automation of data collection from energy meters, specifically at some parts of the plant.

## Technologies and Devices Used

### Protocols and Communication
- **Modbus RTU/TCP:** Standard protocol for industrial communication, used over RS485.
- **RS485:** Robust, noise-resistant communication standard suitable for industrial environments.

### Hardware
- **Waveshare Rail-Mount Serial Server:** RS485 to WiFi/Ethernet module for seamless data transmission.
- **USR-W610:** RS232/485 to WiFi/Ethernet converter, supports MQTT, TCP, UDP protocols.

### Cloud Platform
- **ThingSpeak:** Platform used for real-time data visualization and analytics.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Data Access:** Enables monitoring from any location with an internet connection.
- **Data Logging:** Built-in capability for historical data analysis.
- **Multiple Communication Ports:** Supports RS485 and Ethernet, facilitating IoT integration.
- **Wide Voltage Range:** Operates on 85-265V AC/DC, ensuring industrial compatibility.
- **Remote Monitoring:** Allows for remote configuration and real-time data access through IoT platforms.

## Prototype Demonstration
